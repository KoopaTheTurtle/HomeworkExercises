BCDE223 Best Programming Practices (Java)

A series of files listed for homework exercises that have my answers to them.
Do note that if you are copying and pasting these please dont. Try and uses these as a reference instead for your own code. Maybe use this as an understanding for why somehting didn't work.

This is made using Eclipse IDE. You can drop the Folder inside your SRC folder and be able to use it. This does use the MVC file structure so please understand that first.

Of course all due respect does to Tim and Sam in the same class as me. Without them I dont know what I would be doing. They have been a great help to me, not only in this Java class but in all classes we have shared. They don't straight up give me the answer they walk me througt giving me hints or direction in how to do the task and only really help me when I have an error I do not understand.

The PDF of the Exercise's is also given here. If you are wanting to do your own learning you are free to download. Do note that not everything the internet is helpful when you google it so dont be afraid to ask people for help. I myself have asked many questions onto Stackoverflow for help and have always been given swift and understanding answers.






Any comments for improvement are welcome. You may have an improvement on something but it could be something that isn't for myself and others cause everyone's brain ticks differently so please don't get all angry at others and carefully explain yourself as well to reduce misscommunication :)
