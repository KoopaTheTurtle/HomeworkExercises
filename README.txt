BCDE223 Best Programming Practices (Java)

A series of files listed for homework exercises that have my answers to them.
Do note that if you are copying and pasting these please dont. Try and uses these as a reference instead for your own code. Maybe use this as an understanding for why somehting didn't work.

Of course all due respect does to Tim and Sam in the same class as me. Without them I dont know what I would be doing. They have been a great help to me, not only in this Java class but in all classes we have shared. They don't straight up give me the answer they walk me througt giving me hints or direction in how to do the task and only really help me when I have an error I do not understand.

The PDF of the Exercise's is also given here. If you are wanting to do your own learning you are free to download. Do note that not everything the internet is helpful when you google it so dont be afraid to ask people for help. I myself have asked many questions onto Stackoverflow for help and have always been given swift and understanding answers.

One hint I will give you: Populating an ArrayList is really simple, In your loop just make sure you have array.add([what you want to add to the ArrayList]) i.e. If you were looping through to produce a Sum and an Average you may use a forloop with int i being your smallest number (1) and making it less than or equal to your highest number (say 1000) it will be helpful to add the numbers to a ArrayList so you can then just do Sum/arraylist.size()
